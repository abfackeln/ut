abfackelns Server Utilities (ASU) for Unreal Tournament

ASU Unreal Tournament for Linux

If you have ever tried to install Unreal Tournament on a Linux box, you have no doubt come across a handful of pitfalls which make it difficult and annoying to set up.  It took me a long while to set up a server that was fully-functional and stable, and even longer to figure out how I did it. 

Over time, I have attempted to share my knowledge with the Linux-Unreal community by providing patches, scripts and a complete server installer package which has been developed for 4 different versions of Unreal Tournament (402a, 413a, 428a and 436) since its first release in 1999.  However, installing your server is only the beginning.  Which is where ASU comes in:  ASU is an extensive utility consisting mostly of scripts and patches and a simple-to-use, menu-based interface.  ASU will allow you to customize your server in seconds without having to remember all of the optimizations and tweaks that every server needs to get running smoothly.  Even if you are not a server administrator, you can use ASU to install umods and patches on to your Unreal Tournament for Linux client.

Key features of abfackelns UT installer package:

* Easy-access to modify most of the common ini settings.
* Umod installation and removal.
* Intelligent patching system with patches for CSHP and ngWorldStats.
* Custom "rc.d" style init scripts to start and stop the server.
* Init script options to ensure that the server stays up!
* Configurable number of bots to be in each game by default.
* Map or skin download redirection of files larger than 100k.

ASU is currently in its beta-testing phase, and is being offered free without warrantee (as always).  If you have any problems, comments or suggestions please visit the abfackeln.com Unreal Tournament for Linux support page at http://ut.abfackeln.com/support.html
